    <releaseNotes>With the release of Minecraft 1.20.6, we've had to make some changes to our Java installer to make sure it plays nicely with the new version of Minecraft.
###🎉 Added
* CurseForge mods will now have a "CurseForge" badge in the mod details that will take you to the mod page on the CurseForge website #716
###🔧 Changed
* Made some minor modifications to the app to better handle having no internet connection
* When installing a modern Minecraft modpack on an Arm system, the app should now install an Arm compatible version of Java
###🐞 Fixed
* Fixed some instances not being abled to be installed due to empty space at the end of the instance name. #1114
* Fixed the apps internal titlebar still showing when the app is being started #1105 thanks to @su226
* Fixed the Java installer not working for 1.20.6+
* Added missing Java licenses to our open source page
* Installing custom mods would result in their curseforge link being set to "Project Page", this has now been fixed
* Possible fix for Linux systems that have issues with sandboxing when using Electron #1123
###🗑 Removed
* Legacy Minecraft Login remaining code has been removed as this is no longer supported by Mojang
