    <releaseNotes>###üîß Changed
* Log backups with no longer stack indefinitely and will not auto delete after 5 backups or after 7 days
* Added an option to remove instance logs from the log exporter functionality in the app settings
* Added fallback endpoints to the Minecraft Authentication flow. Although we don't think this will do anything, it's worth being more inline with other platforms.
* Added logging for all Fetch requests made by our Java subprocess which should help out team debug networking issues when they're reported
* The RAM slider is now limited to at least 1GB of RAM.
###üêû Fixed
* Update button on Modpacks showing even when the Modpack has been updated
* Modpack category will now save when changed in the Modpack settings menu
* Mod Loader selection will now actually apply instead of applying the default option every time
* The RAM slider will no longer spam "Settings Saved" when moved
* Creating an instance after having previously created an instance will no longer result in the RAM and screen resolution being set to zeros
* Resolved a potential deadlock in the authentication flow for starting a pack causing users to get stuck in a "logging in" state
