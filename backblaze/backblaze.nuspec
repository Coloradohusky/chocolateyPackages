    <releaseNotes>### Improvements
* Restrictions were removed that prevented certain large files from being backed up.
* The threading mechanism was optimized to enhance performance and efficiency in data operations.
* Files with missing chunks are now automatically repaired when possible.
### Bug Fixes
* Unnecessary files were removed to prevent the drive from reaching capacity.
* An issue was resolved that caused the Next button to briefly appear when the installer is re-run.
* An issue was resolved that caused an unresponsive Close button to appear on the "Install Complete" modal.
* An issue was resolved that caused the app to freeze and display an error when logging in with a single-sign on (SSO) account.
* An issue was resolved where selecting the wrong SSO caused the client to time out.
